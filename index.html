      <h2>An Introduction to Early Islam.</h2>
      <p>
        Dawn of Islam: An Introduction to Early Islam presents a critical
        historical and theological introduction to Islam. Focusing on the early
        periods of Islam, the author investigates how Islam began, including its
        religious and historical background, main historical figures, initial
        beginning, and subsequent expansion. The book also presents a critical
        analysis of the Quran and the history of its transmission.While Dawn of
        Islam is an introductory text on Islam, it provides comprehensive
        coverage of the main elements of the religion. Written in a concise
        manner, the book is intended to lay a solid foundation for further study
        of Islam in the more in-depth works published by the Religion Research
        Institute.The book is recommended for those western laymen who want an
        accurate but easy-to-read and concise historical account of early Islam
        and for students of Islam and those who desire a deeper understanding of
        this historical period. Finally, the book provides an introductory
        academic textual criticism of the Quran.

        Islam, major world religion promulgated by the Prophet Muhammad in
        Arabia in the 7th century CE. The Arabic term islām, literally
        “surrender,” illuminates the fundamental religious idea of Islam—that
        the believer (called a Muslim, from the active particle of islām)
        accepts surrender to the will of Allah (in Arabic, Allāh: God). Allah is
        viewed as the sole God—creator, sustainer, and restorer of the world.
        The will of Allah, to which human beings must submit, is made known
        through the sacred scriptures, the Qurʾān (often spelled Koran in
        English), which Allah revealed to his messenger, Muhammad. In Islam
        Muhammad is considered the last of a series of prophets (including Adam,
        Noah, Abraham, Moses, Solomon, and Jesus), and his message
        simultaneously consummates and completes the “revelations” attributed to
        earlier prophets.

        m the very beginning of Islam, Muhammad had inculcated a sense of
        brotherhood and a bond of faith among his followers, both of which
        helped to develop among them a feeling of close relationship that was
        accentuated by their experiences of persecution as a nascent community
        in Mecca. The strong attachment to the tenets of the Qurʾānic revelation
        and the conspicuous socioeconomic content of Islamic religious practices
        cemented this bond of faith. In 622 CE, when the Prophet migrated to
        Medina, his preaching was soon accepted, and the community-state of
        Islam emerged. During this early period, Islam acquired its
        characteristic ethos as a religion uniting in itself both the spiritual
        and temporal aspects of life and seeking to regulate not only the
        individual’s relationship to God (through conscience) but human
        relationships in a social setting as well. Thus, there is not only an
        Islamic religious institution but also an Islamic law, state, and other
        institutions governing society. Not until the 20th century were the
        religious (private) and the secular (public) distinguished by some
        Muslim thinkers and separated formally in certain places such as Turkey.
        This dual religious and social character of Islam.
